    <h3 id="national-parks-heading1">Yellowstone National Park</h3>
    <ul id="national-parks1">
        <li>Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872.</li>
        <li>Yellowstone is the world’s first national park.</li>
        <li>Highest Point: 11,358 feet (3,462 m; Eagle Peak)</li>
        <li>Lowest Point: 5,282 feet (1,610 m; Reese Creek)</li>
        <li>Larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="national-parks-heading2">Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
    <ul id="national-parks2">
        <li><strong>DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW OLD IT IS</strong>
            It has long been believed that the Colorado River began carving the Grand Canyon about 6 million years ago,
            but a 2012 study contained a real shocker,
            suggesting that the process may have begun as far back as 70 million years. In all likelihood,
            the Grand Canyon as we know it today started out as a series of smaller canyons 70 million years ago,
            but the majority of the canyon did not begin to take shape until much more recently.</li>

        <li> <strong>IT'S NOT THE DEEPEST CANYON IN THE WORLD</strong>
            The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon in Tibet plummets to a depth of 17,567 feet,
            making it more than 2 miles deeper than the Grand Canyon's 6,093 feet.
            The Tibetan canyon is also about 30 miles longer than the Grand Canyon. </li>
        <li>THERE ARE NO DINOSAUR BONES IN THE GRAND CANYON

            The Grand Canyon might look like the perfect place to go looking for dinosaur bones,
            but none have ever been found there, and for good reason.
            The rock that makes up the canyon walls is vastly more ancient than the dinosaurs –
            about a billion years more ancient, in some cases –
            but the canyon itself probably didn't form until after the dinosaurs were long gone.</li>

        <li> <strong>FISH ARE RELATIVELY UNCOMMON IN THE GRAND CANYON</strong>
            Prior to modern flood control measures,
            the Colorado River provided a uniquely difficult habitat for fish,
            with heavy silt, frequent floods,
            and temperatures ranging from extreme heat in summer to sub-freezing in winter.
            As a result, only eight fish species are native to the Grand Canyon,
            six of which are found nowhere outside of the Colorado River.</li>
        <li>THERE'S A TOWN IN THE GRAND CANYON

            Lists of Grand Canyon facts don’t often include information about its human population,
            but surprisingly, it does have one.
            Supai Village is located at the base of the Grand Canyon within the Havasupai Indian Reservation.
            Inaccessible by road and with a population of just 208,
            it is the most remote community in the lower 48 states,
            and is the only place where mail is still delivered by pack mule. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="national-parks-heading3">Yosemite National Park</h3>
    <ul id="national-parks3">
        <li>Yosemite National Park, located in the state of California,
            covers 761,268 acres of land.</li>
        <li>There is a granite formation in Yosemite called the Half Dome.
            It reaches 5,000 feet above the floor of the valley.</li>
        <li>There is a waterfall in the park named Bridalveil Falls.
            Because the wind blows the falling water to the side,
            it looks like a bride's veil blowing in the wind.
        </li>
        <li>It is believed that a glacier is responsible for producing the shape of Yosemite Valley.</li>
        <li>The mountains located in Yosemite still grow about one foot every 1,000 years.</li>
